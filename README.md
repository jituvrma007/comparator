# JSON Comparator Utility - Api Assignment For SDET

This is a comparator project which can be used to compare 2 API responses. The input to this project should be two files with request URLs. 
<br/> Each file should contain (HTTP/HTTPS) API's separated by a new line.


## Dependencies

Here are the dependencies used in the project for development & testing perspective. 
<br/> Note - All are open source project and widely available over the web. Setup the maching with below applications to test the code further.

* [Java 1.8](https://www.java.com/en/) - Coding Language
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management
* [RestAssured](http://rest-assured.io/) - Used to get API Response
* [json](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.json/json) - JSON encoders/decoders in Java
* [JUnit](https://junit.org/) - Testing framework for Java

## Testing with two files containing request URLs in each files. 

```
Sample code test this project with files.

import com.assignment.comparator.Comparator;
import com.assignment.comparator.ComparatorImpl;

Comparator comparator = new ComparatorImpl();
// Creating object of implementation class.

String FileName1 = System.getProperty("user.dir")+ "/Files/Sample1.txt";
// creating the variable FileName1 with complete path and file extension.

String FileName2 = System.getProperty("user.dir")+ "/Files/Sample2.txt";
// creating the variable FileName2 with complete path and file extension.	

comparator.isJsonEqual(FileName1, FileName2);
//Calling the method, and passing both the file name.
	
```


<br/> Note - For above piece of code, We have below files placed inside workspace directory.
<br/>
<br/>
* Sample1.txt
<br/>
* Sample2.txt
<br/>
<br/>
Output should be like below -

```
https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2 not equals https://reqres.in/api/users/2
https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2 equals https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2
https://reqres.in/api/users/1 not equals https://reqres.in/api/unknown
https://reqres.in/api/users/2 equals http://reqres.in/api/users/2
https://reqres.in/api/users/4 not equals https://reqres.in/
====>> Invalid URL ====>> /in/api/
/in/api/ not equals https://reqres.in/api/users/2
```

## In case you want to use this in some other project. 

```
1) Run the project locally on local machine.
2) Use below dependency in pom.xml file of the other project.
3) You will see "comparator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar" file in Maven Dependencies
4) Use above sample code to write your test/feature.
```
```
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.assignment</groupId>
	<artifactId>comparator</artifactId>
